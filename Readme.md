2. Unzip the downloaded file and open the app
3. Select whether you would like to organize or remove unnecessary files
4. Press the choose folder button and select a folder you would like to perform the action on

Tip: Removing unnecessary files deletes the duplicate and archive files but it doesn't delete them permanently. It moves the files to trash where they can be reviewed by you.
